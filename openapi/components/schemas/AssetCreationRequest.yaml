Fisher''s paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. <i>(See Duda & Hart, for example.)</i> The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are <strong>NOT</strong> linearly separable from each other.'
