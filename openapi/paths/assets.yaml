                This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
                pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in
                the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda &
                Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50
                instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
                One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are
                NOT linearly separable from each other.
